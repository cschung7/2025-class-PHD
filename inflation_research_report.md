### Query 1: US consumer price index CPI inflation rate August September ...

**Response:**
The latest official data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) shows that the **Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate for August 2025** increased by **2.9% over the 12 months ending August**, up from 2.7% for the 12 months ending July 2025**. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the CPI rose **0.4% in August 2025**, following a 0.2% increase in July 2025[1][2][3].

Key details for August 2025 include:

- The **all items index rose 0.4% seasonally adjusted** in August.
- The **shelter index increased 0.4%**, the largest contributor to the monthly rise.
- The **food index rose 0.5%**, with food at home up 0.6% and food away from home up 0.3%.
- The **energy index increased 0.7%**, driven by a 1.9% rise in gasoline prices.
- The CPI excluding food and energy rose 0.3% in August, consistent with July's increase.
- Over the last 12 months, the CPI excluding food and energy rose **3.1%**.
- The energy index increased only 0.2% over the last 12 months.
- The food index increased 3.2% over the last year[1][2][3].

As of September 12, 2025, the **BLS has not yet released the CPI data for September 2025**. The August 2025 report is the most recent official inflation data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In summary:

| Month       | Monthly CPI Change (SA) | 12-Month CPI Inflation Rate (NSA) | 12-Month CPI Less Food & Energy (NSA) |
|-------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| July 2025   | +0.2%                  | 2.7%                              | 3.1%                                  |
| August 2025 | +0.4%                  | 2.9%                              | 3.1%                                  |

(SA = seasonally adjusted; NSA = not seasonally adjusted)[1][2][3][4].

### Query 2: US core inflation rate August September 2025 excluding food ...

**Response:**
The **US core inflation rate (CPI excluding food and energy)** for the 12 months ending August 2025 was **3.1%**. For August 2025 alone, the core CPI rose **0.3%** seasonally adjusted[1][2].

The **all items CPI** increased 2.9% over the 12 months ending August 2025, up from 2.7% for the 12 months ending July 2025[1][2].

Regarding the **Federal Reserve's inflation target**, it is generally around **2% annual inflation** for the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is closely related but not identical to the CPI. The August 2025 core CPI inflation rate of 3.1% remains above this target, indicating inflation pressures persist above the Fed's preferred level[1][2].

As of September 12, 2025, the official September CPI data has not yet been released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, so the latest confirmed data is for August 2025[4]. 

**Summary:**

| Month/Period           | Core Inflation Rate (CPI less food & energy) | All Items CPI Inflation | Fed Target (approx.) |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| August 2025 (12-month) | 3.1%                                        | 2.9%                   | ~2.0%               |
| August 2025 (monthly)  | +0.3% (seasonally adjusted)                  | +0.4% (seasonally adj.) |                     |
| September 2025         | Data not yet released                        |                        |                     |

This shows core inflation remains elevated relative to the Fed's target as of August 2025[1][2][4].

### Query 3: US inflation trends 2024 2025 Federal Reserve monetary polic...

**Response:**
From January 2024 to January 2025, the U.S. Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased by **3.0%**, indicating moderate inflation compared to previous years when inflation was higher[1]. For the 12 months ending August 2025, the CPI rose **2.9%**, with core inflation (all items less food and energy) increasing by **3.1%** over the same period[4]. Monthly inflation showed some volatility, with a 0.4% increase in August 2025 alone, driven largely by shelter, food, and energy prices[4].

Regarding Federal Reserve monetary policy, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) projections from June 2025 indicate that the Fed expects **PCE inflation** (Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure) to be around **3.0% in 2025**, with a median projection declining to **2.4% in 2026** and **2.1% in 2027**[2]. The Fed's participants see inflation risks as weighted to the upside, suggesting some uncertainty and potential for inflation to remain above target in the near term[2].

The FOMC's projections for the federal funds rate in mid-2025 reflect a cautious stance, with the median expected to remain elevated to manage inflation pressures, though exact rate levels were not detailed in the search results. The Fed has been balancing inflation control with economic growth and unemployment considerations, projecting moderate GDP growth and stable unemployment rates[2].

In summary:

| Indicator                      | Value/Trend (2024-2025)                  |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| CPI Inflation (Jan 2024-Jan 2025) | +3.0%                                  |
| CPI Inflation (12 months ending Aug 2025) | +2.9% (all items), +3.1% (core)      |
| Monthly CPI (Aug 2025)         | +0.4% (seasonally adjusted)              |
| Fed PCE Inflation Projection   | 3.0% (2025), 2.4% (2026), 2.1% (2027)   |
| Fed Monetary Policy            | Elevated federal funds rate expected; inflation risks weighted to upside |

This data reflects a trend of inflation moderating from the high levels seen in 2022-2023 but still above the Fed's 2% target, prompting continued vigilance in monetary policy[1][2][4].

### Query 5: Federal Reserve inflation target 2025 Jerome Powell monetary...

**Response:**
The Federal Reserve's **inflation target for 2025 remains at 2 percent**, consistent with its longer-run goal to promote price stability and maximum employment. Chair Jerome Powell and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reaffirm this target as central to anchoring inflation expectations and guiding monetary policy decisions[2][3].

As of June 2025, the FOMC has maintained the **federal funds rate target range at 4.25% to 4.5%**, reflecting a stance aimed at balancing ongoing inflation moderation with solid labor market conditions. Inflation has moderated but remains somewhat elevated, and the Fed is positioned to adjust rates as needed based on incoming data and economic developments[1].

Powell emphasized that the 2 percent inflation target is low enough to prevent inflation concerns from distorting household and business decisions while allowing the Fed flexibility to support the economy during downturns. The Fed continues to monitor inflation expectations closely to ensure they remain well anchored around this target[3].

The Fed’s monetary policy strategy involves careful assessment of economic indicators, including inflation, employment, and growth, to determine the appropriate path for interest rates. The FOMC projects economic outcomes and interest rates to foster maximum employment and price stability, with ongoing adjustments as necessary[1][4].

In summary:

| Aspect                         | Details                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inflation Target               | 2 percent (annual change in personal consumption price index)                            |
| Federal Funds Rate (June 2025) | 4.25% to 4.5%                                                                           |
| Inflation Status               | Moderating but still somewhat elevated                                                  |
| Monetary Policy Approach       | Data-dependent, balancing inflation control and employment support                       |
| Inflation Expectations         | Well anchored around 2 percent, supported by Fed’s commitment and communication          |
| Chair Jerome Powell’s View     | 2% target provides stability and policy flexibility; Fed committed to transparency      |

This framework and policy stance were detailed in the June 2025 Monetary Policy Report, the 2025 Statement on Longer-Run Goals, and Powell’s August 2025 speech[1][2][3].
