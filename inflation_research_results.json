Inflation has moderated but remains somewhat elevated, and the Fed is positioned to adjust rates as needed based on incoming data and economic developments[1].\n\nPowell emphasized that the 2 percent inflation target is low enough to prevent inflation concerns from distorting household and business decisions while allowing the Fed flexibility to support the economy during downturns. The Fed continues to monitor inflation expectations closely to ensure they remain well anchored around this target[3].\n\nThe Fed\u2019s monetary policy strategy involves careful assessment of economic indicators, including inflation, employment, and growth, to determine the appropriate path for interest rates. The FOMC projects economic outcomes and interest rates to foster maximum employment and price stability, with ongoing adjustments as necessary[1][4].\n\nIn summary:\n\n| Aspect                         | Details                                                                                   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Inflation Target               | 2 percent (annual change in personal consumption price index)                            |\n| Federal Funds Rate (June 2025) | 4.25% to 4.5%                                                                           |\n| Inflation Status               | Moderating but still somewhat elevated                                                  |\n| Monetary Policy Approach       | Data-dependent, balancing inflation control and employment support                       |\n| Inflation Expectations         | Well anchored around 2 percent, supported by Fed\u2019s commitment and communication          |\n| Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s View     | 2% target provides stability and policy flexibility; Fed committed to transparency      |\n\nThis framework and policy stance were detailed in the June 2025 Monetary Policy Report, the 2025 Statement on Longer-Run Goals, and Powell\u2019s August 2025 speech[1][2][3].",

The 12-month annual inflation rate ending in July was 2.7%[1][2][3].\n- **August 2025**: The CPI-U increased by 0.4% month-over-month (seasonally adjusted), up from July\u2019s 0.2%. The annual inflation rate for the 12 months ending August rose to 2.9%, up from 2.7% in July. Key contributors to the August monthly increase included shelter (+0.4%), food (+0.5%), and energy (+0.7%), with gasoline rising 1.9% in August[1][2][3].\n- **September 2025**: As of September 12, 2025, the official CPI data for September has not yet been released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, so month-over-month and annual inflation comparisons for September 2025 are not available[1][2][3].\n\nIn summary, inflation showed a modest acceleration from July to August 2025, with the annual inflation rate increasing from 2.7% to 2.9%.

      "The Federal Reserve's **inflation target for 2025 remains at 2 percent**, consistent with its longer-run goal to promote price stability and maximum employment. Chair Jerome Powell and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reaffirm this target as central to anchoring inflation expectations and guiding monetary policy decisions[2][3].\n\nAs of June 2025, the FOMC has maintained the **federal funds rate target range at 4.25% to 4.5%**, reflecting a stance aimed at balancing ongoing inflation moderation with solid labor market conditions. Inflation has moderated but remains somewhat elevated, and the Fed is positioned to adjust rates as needed based on incoming data and economic developments[1].\n\nPowell emphasized that the 2 percent inflation target is low enough to prevent inflation concerns from distorting household and business decisions while allowing the Fed flexibility to support the economy during downturns. The Fed continues to monitor inflation expectations closely to ensure they remain well anchored around this target[3].\n\nThe Fed\u2019s monetary policy strategy involves careful assessment of economic indicators, including inflation, employment, and growth, to determine the appropriate path for interest rates. The FOMC projects economic outcomes and interest rates to foster maximum employment and price stability, with ongoing adjustments as necessary[1][4].\n\nIn summary:\n\n| Aspect                         | Details                                                                                   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Inflation Target               | 2 percent (annual change in personal consumption price index)                            |\n| Federal Funds Rate (June 2025) | 4.25% to 4.5%                                                                           |\n| Inflation Status               | Moderating but still somewhat elevated                                                  |\n| Monetary Policy Approach       | Data-dependent, balancing inflation control and employment support                       |\n| Inflation Expectations         | Well anchored around 2 percent, supported by Fed\u2019s commitment and communication          |\n| Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s View     | 2% target provides stability and policy flexibility; Fed committed to transparency      |\n\nThis framework and policy stance were detailed in the June 2025 Monetary Policy Report, the 2025 Statement on Longer-Run Goals, and Powell\u2019s August 2025 speech[1][2][3]."
